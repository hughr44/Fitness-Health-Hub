## Why I Tried Lion's Mane

As someone who juggles a busy workload, a growing blog, and multiple side projects, mental fatigue and brain fog have been real challenges. I'd heard great things about Lion's Mane mushrooms and their potential to support memory, focus, and even mood, so I decided to try the Host Defense Lion's Mane supplement, which is widely praised and made by the well-known mycologist Paul Stamets.

I chose this specific brand because of its reputation for quality and sustainabilityâ€”it uses certified organic mushrooms and avoids fillers. Plus, it's made in the USA and formulated with mushroom mycelium and fruit body.

## My Experience After 60 Days

I've been taking two capsules daily (the suggested serving size) for the past two months. Here's what I noticed:

### ðŸ§  Improved Focus and Mental Clarity

Within about 10â€“14 days, I felt like my thoughts were sharper. I was able to focus on tasks for longer periods without as much distraction or procrastination.

### ðŸ’­ Better Memory Recall

This one surprised me. I felt like names, small tasks, and random bits of information came to me more quickly and fluidly.

### ðŸ˜Œ Calm Energy and Mood Support

There was a subtle but noticeable improvement in my overall mood and mental resilience. I wouldn't describe it as a stimulant-like effectâ€”more like a background hum of clarity.

Again, these are just subjective observationsâ€”but they were consistent enough for me to reorder the supplement and continue using it.

## What Does the Science Say?

Lion's Mane mushrooms (Hericium erinaceus) have been the subject of growing research in recent years, especially for their neuroprotective and nootropic (cognitive-enhancing) effects.

Here are some interesting findings:

### ðŸ”¬ Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) Stimulation

Lion's Mane contains compounds called hericenones and erinacines, which have been shown to stimulate Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) synthesisâ€”a protein crucial for the growth and survival of neurons.

**Study:** Kawagishi et al., 1994 â€“ Identified NGF-enhancing compounds in Lion's Mane.

### ðŸ§ª Memory and Cognitive Function in Humans

A 2009 double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that individuals with mild cognitive impairment who took Lion's Mane for 16 weeks showed significant improvement in cognitive function compared to the placebo group.

**Study:** Mori et al., 2009 â€“ Improving cognitive function with oral intake of Hericium erinaceus.

### ðŸ§¬ Neuroprotection and Antioxidant Support

Lion's Mane has also demonstrated potential in reducing neuroinflammation and protecting against oxidative stress, which are factors in brain aging.

**Study:** Zhang et al., 2016 â€“ Showed Lion's Mane reduced neuroinflammation in animal models.
