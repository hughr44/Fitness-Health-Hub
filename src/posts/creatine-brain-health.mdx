Creatine is often associated with muscle building and gym performance â€” but did you know it may also support brain recovery after concussions and traumatic brain injury (TBI)?

In a recent video, neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains how creatine plays a powerful role in brain energy metabolism and may offer neuroprotective benefits during brain trauma recovery.

Whether you're an athlete, coach, or just health-conscious, understanding creatine's effects on the brain after injury could be a game-changer.

## ðŸ§¬ What Is Creatine and How Does It Affect the Brain?

Creatine is a compound that helps regenerate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) â€” your body's primary energy molecule. While it's popular in fitness circles, creatine is naturally found in the brain, where it helps neurons stay energized and function properly.

According to Dr. Huberman, after a concussion or TBI, the brain's ATP levels drop significantly, which causes neurons to struggle with energy production and repair. Supplementing with creatine may help stabilize cellular energy and reduce neurological damage.

## ðŸ§  3 Brain Health Benefits of Creatine After a Concussion

### 1. Restores Cellular Energy

After head trauma, the brain experiences an energy crisis. Creatine helps buffer that drop by supporting ATP regeneration, allowing neurons to function and repair themselves more effectively.

### 2. Neuroprotective Properties

Studies cited by Dr. Huberman show that creatine may protect brain cells against damage caused by inflammation and oxidative stress â€” both of which are common after a concussion.

### 3. Faster Cognitive Recovery

Some early research suggests creatine supplementation may improve cognitive recovery after head injuries, helping restore focus, memory, and overall mental clarity.

## ðŸ“š What the Research Says

In his video, Dr. Huberman references animal studies and early human trials showing that creatine may:

- Lower concussion symptom severity
- Speed up recovery in young athletes
- Reduce mitochondrial damage in brain cells after trauma

Although more large-scale human trials are needed, the results are promising enough to consider creatine as part of a comprehensive concussion recovery plan.

## ðŸ’Š Dosage and Safety

While 3â€“5 grams of creatine monohydrate per day is a typical maintenance dose, Dr. Huberman advises consulting a healthcare provider â€” especially if you're recovering from a brain injury.

He also notes that pre-loading creatine before injury (e.g., in contact sports) may offer greater protection, although this approach needs more clinical validation.

## ðŸ‘‡ Final Thoughts: Should You Take Creatine for Brain Health?

Creatine is no longer just a gym supplement. It's gaining attention as a neurosupportive compound that may aid in concussion recovery and overall brain health.

Dr. Andrew Huberman's breakdown highlights how creatine can restore cellular energy, protect neurons, and potentially speed up brain healing after trauma.

âœ… If you're active in contact sports or recovering from a concussion, creatine might be worth discussing with your doctor.
